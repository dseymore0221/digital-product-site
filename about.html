          <h1>Our Story</h1>
          <p>
            The Productivity Toolkit was created by a small team of
            entrepreneurs who needed a way to stay organized and creative while
            launching their own digital products. After experimenting with
            countless tools, we discovered that combining a thoughtfully
            structured Notion workspace with the power of AI prompts provided
            the perfect balance of clarity and innovation.

            <h2>Our mission</h2>
            <p>
              We believe that anyone can build a successful online business with
              the right systems and inspiration. Our goal is to empower
              solopreneurs and small teams by providing tools that simplify
              operations, spark creativity and scale with growth.

            <h2>Why we built this</h2>
            <p>
              We struggled with juggling multiple platforms, scattered notes and
              constant context switching. By documenting our own processes and
              curating AI prompts, we built a system that worked. Now we’re
              sharing it with others who want to streamline their workflow and
              focus on what they do best.
