# Website Template Instructions

This folder contains a static website for the **Notion Productivity & AI Toolkit**.  The site is built with HTML and CSS (no external dependencies) so it can be hosted on any standard web server or uploaded to a platform such as Netlify, Vercel or GitHub Pages.  It includes three pages:

* **index.html** – the home page with a hero section, features overview and call to action.
* **product.html** – a product detail page explaining what’s included, pricing, testimonials and a placeholder "Buy now" button.
* **about.html** – an about page with the backstory and contact information.

The `images` folder contains two decorative illustrations used on the home and product pages.  The styling is defined in `style.css`.

## How to deploy

1. **Unzip** the `website_template.zip` archive to your local machine.
2. If you plan to add e‑commerce functionality, replace the "Buy now" link in `product.html` with the checkout link generated by your payment platform (e.g., Stripe Checkout, PayPal or Gumroad).  Many platforms allow you to embed a button or link that redirects customers to a secure payment page.
3. Test the site locally by opening `index.html` in your browser.  Make any desired adjustments to the text or styling.
4. **Upload to your hosting provider**:
   * For GitHub Pages: create a repository, push the files to the repository and enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
   * For Netlify: drag and drop the folder into the Netlify dashboard or connect the repository.  Netlify will build and deploy automatically.
   * For a traditional web host: upload the files via FTP or a file manager.  Ensure that `index.html` is in the root directory.

## Customization

* **Branding:** Update the site title, logo text and colours in `style.css` to match your brand identity.
* **Content:** Edit the text in the HTML files to reflect your voice and product details.  Replace the testimonials with real customer feedback as it becomes available.
* **Images:** Replace `hero.png` and `features.png` in the `images` folder with your own graphics if desired.  Keep similar aspect ratios for best results.
* **Contact:** Change the email address in `about.html` to your support address.

This simple template provides a professional starting point for your digital product business.  Feel free to expand the site by adding a blog, FAQ page or additional resources.
